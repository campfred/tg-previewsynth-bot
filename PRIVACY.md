# Preview Synth Bot privacy policy

No information about the users or chats the software is involved in will be saved.
However, the software will need to access the URLs sent by users in a chat or explicitly sent in a command or inline query to process it as part of its core function.
The default recommended configuration deploying this sofware disables debugging logs and therefore will not show information about the users or chats it is sollicitated in.
